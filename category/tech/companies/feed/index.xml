<p style="max-width:600px"><a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/fi-unlimited-plans-now-start-20/">Google Fi is cutting the prices</a> of its two unlimited cellular plans while also increasing the amount of high-speed data available (via 9to5Google). The Simply Unlimited plan has been reduced from $60 to $50 per month for one line, while the full-featured Unlimited Plus plan has been reduced from $70 to $65 per month for one line. This is the first time the Unlimited Plus and Simply Unlimited plans have been reduced in price since their launch in 2019 and 2021, respectively.</p>

<p style="max-width:600px">The cheaper cost comes with more high-speed data on both plans, increasing from 22GB to 50GB with the Unlimited Plus plan and from 22GB to 35GB with Simply Unlimited. As noted on the MVNO’s&nbsp;<a href="https://fi.google.com/about/plans/">updated plans page</a>, Google Fi says it will start throttling your data after you exceed either limit. And if you want to use your phone or laptop as a mobile hotspot, Google is adding 5GB for hotspot tethering to its Simply Unlimited plan, a feature previously only available with Unlimited Plus.</p>



<p style="max-width:600px">Both plans now come with unlimited calls to Canada and Mexico. Prior to the upgrade, you could only make free calls to Canada or Mexico when you were travelling within those countries. Google Fi is a pay-as-you-go service. With no changes to its $20 per month for one line and $10 per GB use rate, the Flexible plan now includes free calls to both countries.</p>



<p style="max-width:600px">Although both plans offer unlimited calling, texts, and data, the Simply Unlimited plan has a few limitations compared to the Unlimited Plus plan, including capped hotspot data usage, the inability to share data across other devices such as tablets and fewer supported destinations for free calls, texts, and data.</p>

<p style="max-width:600px">We were making our way to the Rila Mountains, where we were visiting the Rila Monastery where we enjoyed scrambled eggs, toast, mekitsi, local jam and peppermint tea. </p>

<h2 style="max-width:600px">We wandered the site with other tourists</h2>



<p style="max-width:600px">Yet strangely the place did not seem crowded. I’m not sure if it was the sheer size of the place, or whether the masses congregated in one area and didn’t venture far from the main church, but I didn’t feel overwhelmed by tourists in the monastery.</p>

<p style="max-width:600px"> I had low expectations about Sofia as a city, but after the walking tour I absolutely loved the place.
