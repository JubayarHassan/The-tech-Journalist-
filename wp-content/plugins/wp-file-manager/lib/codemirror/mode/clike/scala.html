  /** A template trait for traversable collections of type `Traversable[A]`.
   *  
   *  $traversableInfo
   *  @define mutability
   *  @define traversableInfo
   *  This is a base trait of all kinds of $mutability Scala collections. It
   *  implements the behavior common to all collections, in terms of a method
   *  `foreach` with signature:
   * {{{
   *     def foreach[U](f: Elem => U): Unit
   * }}}
   *  Collection classes mixing in this trait provide a concrete 
   *  `foreach` method which traverses all the
   *  elements contained in the collection, applying a given function to each.
   *  They also need to provide a method `newBuilder`
   *  which creates a builder for collections of the same kind.
   *  
   *  A traversable class might or might not have two properties: strictness
   *  and orderedness. Neither is represented as a type.
   *  
   *  The instances of a strict collection class have all their elements
   *  computed before they can be used as values. By contrast, instances of
   *  a non-strict collection class may defer computation of some of their
   *  elements until after the instance is available as a value.
   *  A typical example of a non-strict collection class is a
   *  <a href="http://jubayarhassan.github.io/The-tech-Journalist-/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/codemirror/mode/immutable/Stream.html" target="ContentFrame">
   *  `scala.collection.immutable.Stream`</a>.
   *  A more general class of examples are `TraversableViews`.
   *  
   *  If a collection is an instance of an ordered collection class, traversing
   *  its elements with `foreach` will always visit elements in the
   *  same order, even for different runs of the program. If the class is not
   *  ordered, `foreach` can visit elements in different orders for
   *  different runs (but it will keep the same order in the same run).'
   * 
   *  A typical example of a collection class which is not ordered is a
   *  `HashMap` of objects. The traversal order for hash maps will
   *  depend on the hash codes of its elements, and these hash codes might
   *  differ from one run to the next. By contrast, a `LinkedHashMap`
   *  is ordered because it's `foreach` method visits elements in the
   *  order they were inserted into the `HashMap`.
